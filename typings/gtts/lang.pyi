def tts_langs() -> dict[Any, Any]:
    """Languages Google Text-to-Speech supports.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary of the type `{ '<lang>': '<name>'}`

            Where `<lang>` is an IETF language tag such as `en` or `zh-TW`,
            and `<name>` is the full English name of the language, such as
            `English` or `Chinese (Mandarin/Taiwan)`.

    The dictionary returned combines languages from two origins:

    - Languages fetched from Google Translate (pre-generated in :mod:`gtts.langs`)
    - Languages that are undocumented variations that were observed to work and
      present different dialects or accents.
